      <!-- Instant Karma -->
      <h2><strong>Jas' Instant Karma in Minecraft - Jas' POV</strong></h2>
      <p>So basically, it was thunderstorming in Minecraft while we were building our houses. It went something like this:</p>
      <p>Xitlaly: "Let's go to sleep."</p>
      <p>Me: "No! We must work through the night!</p>
      <p><i>I gets struck by lightning</i></p>
      <p>Me: AHH! Go to sleep! GO TO SLEEP!</p>

      <!-- Hannah Drops Books -->
      <h2><strong>Hannah Drops Her Sanity - Jas' POV</strong></h2>
      <p> One time in the 8th grade, the bell just rang. It was time for the first class of the day. It was in the morning, and we were all tired. I stayed in the classroom since I had the class. Xitlaly and Hannah got up to leave. Mind you, Hannah carries EVERYTHING with her. As soon as she makes it to the door to leave, she drops everything. Papers spew everywhere. I started laughing in my seat as they laugh too and pick up the mess. There were people stepping over the mess, not offering any help and snickering on the way out. Even the teacher started laughing.</p>

      <!-- Hannah Pins Paper -->
      <h2><strong>Hannah Pins - Jas' POV</strong></h2>
      <p>It was Social Studies, and my friends and I were sitting at the computer lab together. Hannah was at the farthest side next to the wall. The computer teacher asked her to pin a sheet a paper to the board on her right. She does so. Nova then points out the we were missing a piece a paper that we brought and needed for a different class. Nova asked if Hannah pinned it to wall as a joke. Turns out, Hannah actually did pin it behind the sheet the teacher asked to pin. Oh how we laughed.</p>

      <!-- Inspired -->
      <h2><strong>Xitlaly's Inspiration - Xitlaly's POV</strong></h2>
      <p>Everyday I would pass by this poster and would wonder what it said.</p>
      <p>It was designed weirdly where it had "Inspi" in one color at the top and "red" in another at the bottom.</p>
      <p>So everyday I would think "Hmm what is Inspi-red?"</p>
      <p>Then one day, I realized it said "Inspired."</p>
      <p>I promise I can read most english.</p>
      <br>
      <!-- Xitlaly Apologizes -->
      <h2><strong> Xitlaly Apologizes to No one - Jas' POV</strong></h2>
      <p>It was spanish class, and I was talking to Xitlaly. I was sitting down and she was standing up. She backed up enough to bump into someone. She whirls around and says "sorry." Xitlaly then realizes no one was there, and she bumped into a chair. She apologized to a <i> chair</i>. Proud of you. </p>

      <!-- Mya talks about a pic frame -->
      <h2>Doing</h2>
      <p> It was a nice time in Bloxburg, and all of us were just trying to solve escape rooms that Xitlaly made and we were stuck on one of the rooms where we're supposed to help each other. Mya was supposed to help Hannah but Hannah was reading off the google form with instructions that said "Doing." Hannah said that last part out loud and Mya was confused and she said "What's it doing? It's just sitting there."</p>
